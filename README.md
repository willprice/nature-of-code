# Nature of Code exercises

Book link: [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book)

The exercises are done in IntelliJ. Gradle is used to manage the build
dependencies.

## A note on Java
These are done in Java 17 as I dislike the processing editor.
The processing editor basically just puts you inside the context of a subclass
of `PApplet`.
